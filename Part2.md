### Scenario 1: Validate Page Creation

**Description**: This test ensures that the API can successfully create new pages and verify their creation, which is essential for dynamic content management and application functionality.

- **Given**: An API client is ready to create content.
- **When**: The client sends a request to create a new page titled 'Garden Tips'.
- **Then**: The API should confirm the page has been successfully created by returning a success message and the details of the newly created page, including its title and URL. The client should also be able to retrieve the page to verify its existence and content accuracy.
- 
### Scenario 2 : Validate Pagination Functionality

**Description**: Ensuring robust pagination is critical for handling large sets of search results effectively. This test verifies that pagination is implemented correctly, allowing users to navigate through results seamlessly.

- **Given**: An API client is set to use.
- **When**: The client executes a search for 'furry rabbits' with a limit of 5 results per page.
- **Then**: The API should provide a response split into pages, each containing up to 5 results, and include pagination controls like links to the next and previous pages.

### Scenario 3 : Verify Handling of No Results

**Description**: It's important for the API to communicate effectively when no results are available for a given search term, ensuring the client can handle these cases gracefully.

- **Given**: An API client is ready for testing.
- **When**: The client searches for an unfindable term, such as 'habbits23145'.
- **Then**: The API should return an empty set and clearly indicate that no results were found.

### Scenario 4 : Check Error Handling for Invalid Inputs

**Description**: This test ensures the API responds appropriately to invalid search inputs, providing clear error messages to aid in debugging and development.

- **Given**: An API client is utilized.
- **When**: The client submits a search with invalid terms, like special characters or an empty string.
- **Then**: The API should return an error message explaining the nature of the invalid input.

### Scenario 5 : Test Search Functionality with Special Characters

**Description**: This scenario tests whether the API correctly handles searches containing special characters, a necessary feature for robust search functionality.

- **Given**: An API client is in use.
- **When**: The client searches for terms with special characters, e.g., 'AI+++ programming'.
- **Then**: The API should properly interpret special characters and return relevant search results without errors.

### Scenario 6 : Evaluate Multi-Word Search Capability

**Description**: Testing the APIâ€™s ability to process and return accurate results for multi-word search terms ensures that the search functionality meets user needs for specificity and relevance.

- **Given**: An API client is deployed.
- **When**: The client performs a search for 'flowers from amsterdamn'.
- **Then**: The API should accurately return results that match the complete search phrase, ensuring relevance is maintained across the full query.

### Scenario 7: Assess Sorting Mechanisms in Searches

**Description**: Confirming that the API sorts results according to specified criteria is essential for providing users with flexible and relevant search results.

- **Given**: An API client is operational.
- **When**: The client conducts a search for 'furry rabbits' with sorting parameters (e.g., relevance, date, or title).
- **Then**: The API must demonstrate that results are sorted according to the specified criteria, validating the sorting functionality.
